This is a personal website with a number of features:

This was built with a fairly new layout feature CSS Grid. Unlike flexbox this is an actual 2d layout feature. 
This layout is the classic 'holy grail' with 100% Top and Bottom and a central div box that has room for advertising on either side. 
To learn more about Holy Grail layout: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail_(web_design).

Also, I made a 100%vh landing page. This should look like a business card when opened. On the right there is a group of links.
However, one of the links is actually a 'copy to clipboard' of my email. Everyone hates 'mailto:' links, since it opens a desktop mail app.
So, this link is actually a button with all of the styling stripped away and styled in the same style as the rest of the links for 
continuity.

The top 'header' is positioned 'absolutely' and will not scroll with the rest of the website, this allows the user to access email linkedIn and GitHub information at any time.
